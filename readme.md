# Jobsity Android Challenge

## Description

The main purpose of this project is to test what kind of solutions you can give to certain day-to-day tasks and how well you can accomplish good practices. Do not aim to take the test in the shortest possible time, but with the highest quality, you can achieve.

## Assignment
You will develop an application for listing TV series, using the API provided by the TVMaze
website.

You can find the API [here](https://www.tvmaze.com/api).

## Mandatory features

- List all of the series contained in the API used by the paging scheme provided by the API.
- Allow users to search series by name.
- The listing and search views must show at least the name and poster image of the series.
- After clicking on a series, the application should show the details of the series, showing the following information:
  - Name
  - Poster
  - Days and time during which the series airs
  - Genres
  - Summary
  - List of episodes separated by season
- After clicking on an episode, the application should show the episode's information, including:
  - Name
  - Number
  - Season
  - Summary
  - Image, if there is one

## Bonus (Optional)

- Allow the user to set a PIN number to secure the application and prevent unauthorized users.
- For supported phones, the user must be able to choose if they want to enable fingerprint authentication to avoid typing the PIN number while opening the app.
- Allow the user to save a series as a favorite.
- Allow the user to delete a series from the favorites list.
- Allow the user to browse their favorite series in alphabetical order, and click on one to see its details.
- Create a people search by listing the name and image of the person.
- After clicking on a person, the application should show the details of that person, such as:
  - Name
  - Image
  - Series they have participated in, with a link to the series details.

## Considerations

- One of the evaluated criteria is UI / UX notion, so no interface mockup is presented. We do not expect a design masterpiece in your application, but we want an application that respects the guidelines of the platform and that has no usability problems.
- Keep your code and classes well organized.
- Follow the requested proposal. If you want to add new features to the app to make your project even better, complete all tasks first.
- Unit testing is a plus.
- Extra features are also a plus.

## Deliverables

When you finish the assignment, generate the application apk, and place it into a distribution folder. Then, share the repository link with your initial contact via email. Indicate which, if any, of the bonus tasks you completed.

If you didnâ€™t manage to finish everything, please tell us which parts you completed.
